Requirements:
tested on Linux 2.2.x, OpenBSD 2.7, FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE
libpcap - ftp://ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z 
libnet 1.01b - http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet

If you get the error "LIBNET_ETH_H undeclared" when trying to compile, you
have an outdated version of libnet - go get version 1.01b.


-----
Usage:

In the current version, Naptha consists of three programs:

1) bogusarp - make a bogus entry in the router's arp cache so it actually
puts packets with our faked source address on the ethernet. This is done
by sending an arp query from the mac & ip we want cached ever 6.5 seconds.
This is an inelegant hack, and may be replaced in a future version with a
client that actually listens for requests for its IP address and responds
appropriately. Requires the listening ethernet interface (eth0,
ne3,...) to be specified on the command line.

2) synsend - a general purpose program that sends a syn from a host &
port to another host (or network) and port. Used to send the initial SYN
to the victim.

3) srvr - this replaces the ackfin program in naptha 1.0. On the command
line, one specifies the flags to be listened for in upper case. These are
indicated by the first letter of the flag. The flags to be set in the
response packet are the same letters, but in lower case. Flags may be
specified in any order. The functionality of the ackfin program is
obtainted by using the flags -SAaf with srvr.


Notes:
 currently supports ethernet only. The IP you use must be on your local
net, but not in use.

It is possible to run the synsend on a different host anywhere that will
allow you to specify the source address.
