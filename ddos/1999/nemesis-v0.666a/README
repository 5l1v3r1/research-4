N E M E S I S  -  TCP/IP Packet Construction Utility (libnet based)
=======================================================v0.666 ALPHA=======
coded by obecian (special thx to bind for framework and making me start)

* * * FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE DISCLAIMER * * *

This is labeled as an ALPHA release, so do not expect it to perform as a BETA,
or better yet, RELEASE product.  It will stay in ALPHA until the rest of the
protocols are implemented, then work up to a 1.0 release. 

If you find bugs, please report them to obecian@celerity.bartoli.org with
"NEMESIS" in the Subject.  This was released early due to it already imposing
a real world impact in terms of being a useful tool for a number of personal
projects.  This release is aimed at being a great TCP/IP Stack testkit.

Future releases will provide a bigger impact in the spoofing and hijacking
arena.

* * * 

INSTALLATION:  Simple as typing 'make' and you're ready to play!

See "nemesis.html" for info about what is supported in each protocol
and check http://www.packetfactory.net for updates.
