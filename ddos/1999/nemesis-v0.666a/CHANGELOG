=========================================================== PRE RELEASE =======
coded by obecian (special thx to bind for framework and making me start)


CHANGELOG
`````````

11.10.99    Finishing OSPF.  Tied in both ip layer and dll layer options into
            respective protocols.
11.05.99    -v must now be specified on all protocols to get ANY output to
            stdout.  This is done to facilitate injecting several packets
            in sequence via shell scripts without a mess thrown back to the
            user.  
10.31.99    Fixed OSPF and ARP for changes in Libnet 1.0 release.
            All ICMP types/respective codes implemented.
10.10.99    Rebuilt everything -- Nemesis is now a group of tools rather
            than one.  Each protocol has a unique bin.  Less command
            switches =)  built under 0.99g.
		
09.19.99    OSPF mostly in place.
09.09.99    TCP payload from file implemented (rough, but working).

09.04.99    IP/TCP(all flags)/ICMP(some types)/UDP/ARP implemented
            privately released version 0.666 and announced at ToorCon '99.

08.X+n.99   bind started implementing route's samples and framework
            project now being worked on solely by obecian.

08.XX.99    Project thought up to use Libnet for portability.
