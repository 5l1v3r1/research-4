crashme \- test operating environment software robustness
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B crashme
[NBYTES] [SRAND] [NRYTES]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I crashme
is a very simple program that tests the operating environment's
robustness by invoking random data as if it were a procedure.
The standard signals are caught and handled with a setjmp back
to a loop which will try again to produce a fault by executing
random data.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When a signal is caught the number and nature of the signal is indicated.
.SH BUGS
Not all signals are caught, and the state of the user program/process
enviroment can be sufficiently damaged such that the program terminates
before going through all [NTRIES] operations.

Beware: This program can crash your computer and possibly corrupt
your files if the operating system on it is buggy.
