V1.00 First Release.

V1.02 Patched a few minor bugs.
1. Changing  S_un to s.addr which abreviates the structure, but also
makes it more compatible to compile on other machines.
2. The closing of files was changed from close(file) -> fclose(file).
3. Unnecessary variables have been removed.
4. One of the nested loops was incorrectly bracketted around the wrong command.
5. Incorrectly calling the function getname(a). Changed to getname(&a).

V1.03 Minor bugs fixed that make it more compatible on other unixes.
1. Check for NULL file before closing ISS.log. Caused core dump on some unixes.
2. Included <strings.h>
3. Added siginterrupt (SIGALRM,1) to varies parts. Apparently on some machines,
 the signal wasn't being caught until this was set.

V1.10 Added new features and better routines.
1. Changed the method of how to scan allowing a user to be more specific
in which hosts are scanned.
2. Option "-p" implemented to scan individual hosts for all opening tcp port.
3. Sending a QUIT to the SMTP and FTP port.
4. Can now enter just one ip-address to probe that host.
5. Option -o to change the output to something other than ISS.log.
  if "-o -" is spefied, - becomes stdout. Allowing for easier debugging and
  testing.

V1.20 Modified a few more minor bugs.
1. Used htonl() and htons() hopefully to fix byte order of addresses on some machines.
2. Made the socket descriptions all conform to (sd) and changed
close(s) to close(sd).
3. Added more checking of read(s, &c, 1) routines.
4. Allowing the user to just enter one ip-addr to scan that particular host
for security holes.
5. Checks "NoName" as a domainname guess.
6. Increased size of hostnames within program.

V1.21 Few fixes.
1. Options -e and -y turned off more than just what they were suppose to.
2. Cleaned up some code for routines that allowed users to select which 
hosts to scan.
3. Made time-outs longer and checks slightly more efficent for ftp and smtp.
4. #ifdef sun siginterrupt routine.
5. Including <string.h> except for pyramid systems.

V1.3 Big bug and added many vulnerability checking packes
1. On little endian Unix machines, the byte order for the address was being
flipped around.  Therefore if you wanted to scan 1.2.3.4, it would
actually scan 4.3.2.1. Thanks to Barney Wolff, barney@databus.com for
fixing the bug and doing a Unixware port.
2. Added Nfsbug and YPX to the ISS packaging to allow administrators
to further check their problems.
3. Added strobe to the package to allow faster TCP port scanning.
