To build ttt (the TCP Test Tool) just type "make". This will produce
the ttt binary. There is no support for a "install" make target, so
you must copy the ttt executable to a location in your path, like
/usr/local/bin.

ttt was written on Linux and uses the GNU C Library. It does not compile 
on BSD-derived Unixes.

To build ttt you need libssl (from OpenSSL). This requirement is due
to ttt's capability of generating TCP signatures, which are based on
MD5 hashes.

You will need to modify the Makefile to match the location of the libpcap and ssl
libraries and include files.

Successfully compiled on:

gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease) with glibc 2.2.5
