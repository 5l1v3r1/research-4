This is ttt, the TCP Test Tool, version 1.3.

Changes since version 1.2:

- Documentation updates.

- Release using the Cisco Public License (see the file LICENSE.)

Changes since version 1.1:

- Fix bug that caused invalid generation of TCP signature when packet   
  had a TCP payload.

- Generated TCP signatures (ttt's -5 option) were calculated
  incorrectly.

Changes since version 1.0:

- Don't malloc() memory for the IP packet - just use a global array to
  make packet assembly more efficient.

- Fixed nasty bug that caused miscalculation of the length of the IP
  packet when using TCP options.

- Added two new options: --flood <NUM> and --wscale <NUM>.

- Use strtoul() instead of atoi() when converting strings representing
  32-bit numbers to their numerical representations.

- Fixed bug that caused 8-bit numbers (like IP TTL) to be always zero.
