The purpose of the crashme program is to cause instruction faults
that would otherwise be only rarely seen in the normal operation
of a system (where "normal" includes conditions of user programs
with bugs in them, and to executable code corruption due to
memory, disk, and network problems).

Caution: Don't even *think* about running this program on a
system without a projected mode operating of some kind.

For more information see the comments in the code.

Note: The use of srand and rand is unlikely to result in a very
good random mapping unto a machine instruction set.

Infinite loops will be broken out of (presumably) by the ALARM
signal. 10 seconds are given for this. Adjust as needed.

Ideally a shell script should be set up to run crashme again and
again for hours and hours with different input settings.
